## v0.1.0 [2025-06-22]

This is the initial prototype of Merpati. It supports the following basic HTTP actions:

- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
- Custom headers and request bodies
- Basic response viewing

However, this version is limited in tooling and features. The user interface is minimal, and advanced functionality like history, environments, or request scripting is not yet implemented.
